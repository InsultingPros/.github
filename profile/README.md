# Go away

~~Welcome dear user, we believe that you can build healthy community only by sharing and caring for others. That's why we started to collect all the [**Killing Floor 1**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250/Killing_Floor/) good stuff and post our works.~~

Killing Floor community at large can go fuck itself: from a company that gives zero shits about patching their game to rampant mod stealing in an attempt to make one's server stand out.
We don't care to make a better community, nor do we care whether Killing Floor dies or not. We're simply a closed group of people making mods and tools for our own enjoyment.

Yet we still believe in [**cathedral view**](http://wryemusings.com/Cathedral%20vs.%20Parlor.html) one the modding and therefore will make everything we do available here (as well as some mods made by other people with proper credits given).
Repos that we directly own are mostly licensed by [**GPLv3**](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), letting you to easily read, modify and learn stuff. Also, we provide precompiled binary files with redirect, default config files and comments, comments everywhere. Just surf it. And if you find any missing stuff, just contact us / create an Issue-PR.

You suck and we hate you, have a nice day.
